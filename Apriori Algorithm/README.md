Apriori.py

In this file, we have applied the apriori algorithm from the apyori library to generate K-frequent itemsets.
Note that we can only supply a single value for minimum support, thus unable to solve the rare-item problem.

Apriori.py

In this file, we have produced the ms-apriori algorithm for multiple minimum support to generate K-frequent itemsets.
Note that we can have individual minimum support value for each item, thus solving the rare-item problem.
